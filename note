if the chunk is sorted in descending order
    push every item into the stack "A"

but if the topmost item is the least or less than the median
swap the two items
then push the two items to stack "A"

if the chunk is sorted in descending order
    push every item into the stack "A"
if the chunk is not in descending order
scan for the item greater than the median
    if the item is the topmost element
        push into stack "A"
        check again the new chunk if it is in descending order
        if the new chunk is not
        swap "B" and push the two items into stack "A"
    if the item is not the greatest and it is the median value
        check if the next item is the greatest
            if the next item is the greatest 
                swap the median and the greates value and push all 3 items into stack "A"
    if the item is not the greatest and it is less than the median value
        if the next item is the greatest
            swap these two items and push the greatest into stack "A"
            swap the next item again and push both items into stack "A"
        if the next item is not the greatest but the median
            rotate stack "B" twice and push top greatest item to stack "A"
            reverse rotate items back to the top
            swap these two items and push both items to stack "A"

if the chunk is sorted in descending order
    push every item into the stack "A"

if the topmost item is greater than the median value
    Check if this item is larger than other items greater than the median by scanning the CHUNK
    if this item is the greatest push to stack 'A'
    if it is not locate the position of the greatest value and rotate this to the top
    keep record of the rotations because the previous items before the new top item will be at the bottom of
    stack 'B' and you need to bring them back to the top
if the topmost item is not greater than the median
    Look for the item that is far greater than the median compared to others in the CHUNK
    rotate this item to the top
    keep count of the rotations to bring back items in the CHUNK to the top CHUNK
After checking all items greater than the median for the CHUNK
    Total items remaining in chunk = chunk size - (chunk size / 2)
    The items remaining are items less than or equal to the median
    if the topmost value in the chunk is same as the mediann value push this item to stack "A" if it isn't
    repeat the process again until there are two items left
    if there are just 2 items peform the instructions on at most 2 items
